# ChatbotSite

A site displaying Dialogflow chatbot and backend for managment of fulfillments ([deployed with Heroku](https://chatbot-psi.herokuapp.com/)). There are two versions of chat on the site:
- a simple chat (big chat window)  
- dialogflow-messenger (floating in the bottom-right corner of the site)  
Dialogflow-messenger works better, but it's currently in beta so there may be some unexpected problems. Both chats have occasional problems on Firefox browser.
